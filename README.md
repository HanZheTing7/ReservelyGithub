# RESERVELY

## Project Description
This is a portfolio project showcasing my skills in modern Android development. The application demonstrates the use of a clean architecture and integrates with several key third-party services to deliver a robust and feature-rich user experience. It's built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and a MVVM architectural pattern.

## Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using Firebase Authentication.

Real-time Chat: Seamless, real-time messaging functionality powered by the GetStream Chat SDK.

Data Persistence: Real-time and scalable data storage for user profiles, chat history, and other application data via Firebase Firestore.

Media Management: Efficient and reliable handling of image uploads and delivery with Cloudinary.

Modern UI: A beautiful and responsive user interface built entirely with Jetpack Compose.

Clean Architecture: Adherence to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern for maintainability and scalability.

RESTful API Calls: Integration with external services using Retrofit for network communication.

Navigation: A clear and intuitive user flow managed with modern navigation components.

Auto Deletion: Automatic deletion of past events using Firestore's Time-to-Live (TTL) feature for data maintenance.
